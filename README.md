5Task: 

1. Create a To-Do List App
● Problem: Build a simple To-Do list application using React Native. The app should
allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a checkbox to mark
it as completed.
● Requirements:
○ Use useState to manage the list of tasks.
○ Implement a simple UI with text input for adding tasks and a list displaying
tasks.
○ Store the tasks in local storage so that the list persists across app restarts.
● Evaluation Criteria: Code quality, use of React Native components, state
management, and handling of edge cases.
2. Fetch and Display Data from an API
● Problem: Create a React Native app that fetches data from a public API (e.g.,
JSONPlaceholder or any other free API) and displays the results in a flat list.
● Requirements:
○ Use useEffect to fetch data when the component mounts.
○ Display the data in a FlatList.
○ Implement a loading indicator while the data is being fetched.
○ Handle errors that might occur during the API call.
● Evaluation Criteria: Ability to interact with APIs, error handling, use of hooks, and
user experience considerations.


3. Create a Custom Modal Component
● Problem: Build a custom modal component in React Native that can be reused
across different screens. The modal should have a title, a body (which can accept
custom content), and two buttons for "Confirm" and "Cancel".
● Requirements:
○ The modal should be a separate component that can be easily reused.
○ The component should be able to accept props for the title, body content, and
actions for the buttons.
○ Implement animations for opening and closing the modal.
● Evaluation Criteria: Component reusability, prop handling, and ability to implement
animations.

4. Implement a Simple Navigation Flow
● Problem: Create a React Native app with a basic navigation flow using React
Navigation. The app should have at least two screens: a Home screen and a
Details screen.
● Requirements:
○ The Home screen should have a button that navigates to the Details screen.

○ The Details screen should display some information passed from the Home
screen.
○ Implement a back button to return to the Home screen.
● Evaluation Criteria: Understanding of navigation in React Native, prop passing, and
screen transitions.


5. Implement a Form with Validation
● Problem: Build a simple form in React Native with fields for name, email, and
password. Implement basic validation for each field (e.g., required fields, valid email
format, minimum password length).
● Requirements:
○ Use useState to manage form inputs.
○ Display validation errors inline as the user types.
○ The form should only be submittable when all validations pass.
● Evaluation Criteria: Form handling, validation logic, and user feedback
implementation.
